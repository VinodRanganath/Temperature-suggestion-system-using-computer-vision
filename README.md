# Temperature-suggestion-system-using-computer-vision
An intelligent temperature suggestion system using computer vision (OpenCV) to reduce air conditioning loads. The ideal temperature for a room, in a domestic setting, is suggested based on the number of occupants. Using pattern recognition, the number of occupants are determined and is sent to a cloud server (firebase). This data is then fed to a mobile application (Ionic Framework) that will intimate the user of the ideal temperature to be followed in that setting and will create awareness about the potential energy savings that are practically possible.
